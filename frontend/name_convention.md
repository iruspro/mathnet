# Frontend naming convention

- `display` functions are for displaying some content of a 'page'.
- `content` functions are for displaying whole 'pages', including sidebar, top navbar, footer etc.
- Use 'sign in' and 'sign out' instead of 'log in' and 'log out'
- **Conversation** is where messages are shown and posted. So all **chat** stuff must be renamed to **conversation** stuff.
- When listing something, prefer sth_list naming when there are multiple things to be displayed in a list.
